## Final Weekend Lab Part 2 - Build a to do app

For this part of the lab, we'd like you to create a To-do app with the following functionality 

1. The user should be able to create a task 
2. The user should be able to delete a task
3. The user should be able to mark a task as completed 
4. The user should be able to edit a task and change it's text
7. The to-do's should be persisent and stored in a database
8. The app should be a SPA and use the angular router as well as $http to make AJAX calls
6. The to-do app should be styled appropriately 

## Setup

1. Make sure you have a functioning API on the backend before you begin to include your angular code. Test your app in rails console and make sure you can do full CRUD on your to-dos before including angular
2. Once you have a functioning back-end, include angular and the angular router and start on your controller
3. Inside the controller, include the $http module and write functions to create, show, update and delete to-dos. 

## Bonus

1. Have the user edit a task when the task is double clicked (see [ng-Dblclick](xhttps://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngDblclick)) 
2. Change the color of the task to green when it is completed
3. Make the to-do app mobile responsive
